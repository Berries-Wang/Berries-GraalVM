Makes the program work correctly without providing reachability metadata.
This is achieved by preserving all class elements, resources, and reflection metadata in the image.
Usage of this options can cause a large increase in image size, and a small decrease in overall performance.

Usage: -H:Preserve=[all|none|module=<module>|package=<package>|package=<package-wildcard>|path=<cp-entry>][,...]

The flag can be used in following ways:
1. -H:Preserve=all preserves all elements from the JDK, the classpath, and the module path
2. -H:Preserve=module=<module> preserves all elements from a given module
3. -H:Preserve=module=ALL-UNNAMED preserves all elements from all class-path entries
4. -H:Preserve=package=<package> preserves all elements from a given package
5. -H:Preserve=package=<package-wildcard> preserves all elements from packages captured by the wildcard. For example, -H:Preserve=package=my.app.*
6. -H:Preserve=path=<cp-entry> preserves all elements from a given class-path entry
7. -H:Preserve=none disables all previous selections for preservation
8. A comma-separated list of the previous cases. For example, -H:Preserve=path=<cp-entry>,module=<module>,package=<package>

-H:Preserve is only allowed on the native-image command line and cannot be embedded in the native-image.properties files.
